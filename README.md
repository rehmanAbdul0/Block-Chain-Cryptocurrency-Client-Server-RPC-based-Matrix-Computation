# Block-Chain-Cryptocurrency-Client-Server-RPC-based-Matrix-Computation
We will create a client-server application in Golang where the client requests matrix operations from the coordinator, and the coordinator assigns tasks to worker processes. The workers will perform the matrix operations and return the results to the coordinator, which will then send them back to the client.
